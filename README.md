📈 Stock Prediction App
🚀 Overview
This project is a Stock Price Prediction App that utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and ML averaging to forecast stock prices based on historical data. The model is trained on time-series data to provide accurate predictions for future stock trends.

🛠 Tech Stack
Programming Languages: Python
Machine Learning: LSTM, ML averaging
Libraries & Frameworks:
TensorFlow / Keras
Scikit-Learn
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Yahoo Finance API (for stock data)

🔥 Features
✅ Predicts stock prices using LSTM-based deep learning models
✅ Implements ML averaging for enhanced prediction accuracy
✅ Fetches real-time stock data using Yahoo Finance API
✅ Interactive data visualization for trend analysis

📊 Model Training
1️⃣ Load historical stock data using Yahoo Finance API
2️⃣ Preprocess data (scaling, feature selection, train-test split)
3️⃣ Train LSTM model on time-series data
4️⃣ Implement ML averaging for improved predictions
5️⃣ Evaluate model performance using RMSE & MAE
